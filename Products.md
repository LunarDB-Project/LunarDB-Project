# 🌙 LunarDB Products

LunarDB offers two main products: the Command Line Interface (CLI) and the Server. One of the most important common features is that both use Moonlight Query Language to interact with the data. For a brief overview of its capabilities see Moonlight.md.

## 1. 💻 LunarDB CLI

The LunarDB CLI is designed for local use, allowing users to interact with their databases directly from their machines. It provides a powerful and efficient way to manage and query your data without the need for a server setup. This tool is perfect for developers and database administrators who prefer a straightforward command-line approach for database operations.

## 2. 🌐 LunarDB Server

The LunarDB Server, on the other hand, utilizes a WebSocket connection, making it ideal for integration with backend services. It can be accessed through a specific JavaScript API, which facilitates seamless interaction from Node.js backend servers. This setup enables developers to leverage the power of LunarDB in a networked environment, providing robust and scalable database solutions for web applications and services.
